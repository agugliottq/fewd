		<h3>Still a global issue</h3>
		

	<p class="third">
		In 1997 a treaty was signed banning the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of mines, and requiring states to destroy their stockpiles and clear all mined areas as well as assist landmine survivors. 162 states have joined this treaty. The United States did not sign, arguing that landmines are a legitimate weapon when not used indiscriminately. <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red;"> The Mine Ban Treaty.</span> Even though the treaty was signed nearly 20 years ago, landmines are still a major issue today.
		However this does not mean progress hasn't been made. That's not the case. In fact large areas of land have been cleared of mines and put back into use. The number of mines produced has dropped. Sales of mines have all but stopped, resulting in fewer mine victims. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<span style="font-weight: bold; color:red;"> So just what is a landmine?</span> It is a weapon designed to disable or kill a person or destroy a vehicle through damage caused by an explosive blast, shrapnel, (or, in the case of some antitank mines, a jet of molten metal). Land mines are generally buried within 6 inches of the earth's surface, or laid above ground.
		Landmines can remain active for decades after they are buried. For this reason, there is a growing worldwide effort to rid the world of landmines. 
		<br />
		<br />
		According to the 2014 Landmine Monitor report. mines and other buried explosives the previous year caused about 3,308 casualties worldwide. In 2012 the number was 4,325.
		<br />
		<br />
		There are an estimated <span style="font-weight: bolder; color:red;">50 to 100 million</span> landmines still in the ground today. Detection and removal is a difficult process, with serious political, economic, environmental and humanitarian dimensions. Landmines are extremely hard to locate, and disabling and destroying them is a slow, methodical and dangerous exercise. 
	</p>

	<p class="callout">It costs between $3-$30 to make a landmine, <br />
	 but the cost of removing a mine is anywhere from $300 - $1,000.</p>

	<p class="third">
		Simplicity and cost-effectiveness are major factors in explaining the widespread use of landmines in conflict zones in dozens of countries that are now dealing with mine contamination.
		<br />
		<br />
	 	Despite the landmine treaty. there are still some key countries that make and traffic in landmines. Clearance and land rehabilitation still plague civilian populations long after conflicts have ended. 
	 	<br />
		<br />
	 	<span style="font-weight: bolder; color:red;">There is still work to be done. </span>

	<h16>The Victims</h16>
	
	<p class="sixth">
		Every year,<span style="font-weight: bolder; color:red;"> tens of thousands of people, </span> mostly civilians, especially children, are killed or injured by landmines and other explosive leftovers from wars. Those who do survive are often disabled for life. They need long-term care, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and social and economic support. In most mine-affected countries health facilities are disrupted by poverty and war, resulting in a chronic lack of resources to meet these needs.
		<br />
		<br />
		Landmines are designed to be detonated simply by the weight of a person or an object. The suffering can be horrific. Surgeons consider mine injuries among the worst they ever have to treat.

		When someone steps on a buried mine, the detonation is likely to rip off one or both legs. The explosion can drive soil, grass, gravel, metal and plastic fragments of the mine into the victim's wounds and shatter bones high up into the victim's midsection. If the mine explodes while being held, it can	blow off fingers, hands and arms, and can injure the face as well as the abdomen and chest. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<span style="font-weight: bolder; color:red;"> The effects of mines are horrific and devastating.</span> 
		<br />
		<br />
 		According to the 'International Campaign to Ban Landmines Network', more than 4,200 people, of whom <span style="font-weight: bolder; color:red;"> 42% were children </span>, fell victim to landmines in 2012. 
		<br />
		<br />
 		It is estimated that there are 50 to 100 million active landmines. Another 110 million landmines are stockpiled and ready for use. This means that there is one landmine for every 17 children in the world, or one landmine for every 52 people.

	<h14>Just how does one locate a mine?</h14>

	
<p class="ten">
	Landmines can remain active more than <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red;">50 years </span> after they have been planted. Finding their exact location is extremely difficult. Almost all minefields are unmarked, and even those that are mapped take a long time to de-mine. The process of mine detection and de-activation is expensive and time-consuming. Conventional strategies include: metal detectors; sniffer dogs that can detect the vapors emanating from landmines; and simply probing the ground lightly with a bayonet, all the while knowing that just one mistake may cost a life.
	<br />
	<br />
	Technology and research have helped in landmine abatement. One new way to find mines has been developed by the Belgian nonprofit <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red;">APOPO,</span> which uses African giant pouched rats trained to use their highly developed sense of smell to detect TNT. The rats are as big as house cats, yet are still light enough to walk over a landmine without setting it off. 
	<br />
	<br />
	A single rat can search over 2,000 square feet in 20 minutes, a job that would take a human up to four days. The rats have helped clear nearly <span style="font-weight: bold; color:red;">13,200 </span> mines from Tanzania, Mozambique, Angola, and Cambodia. Their success comes only after arduous training. First they need to learn how to be around humans. And since they do not respond to voice commands, they need to be taught that hearing a clicking sound signifies a food reward. Finally they need to be hooked to harnesses and taught to walk a rope grid in the field. It takes about nine months to train each rat.

	<br />
	<br />
	When the rats find a landmine, they stop and scratch the scent of TNT. Someone then marks it and comes back later to excavate. If the rats find a mine, handlers will detonate it on site.

<h15> What can you do?</h15> 

		<p class="eleven">
			
			 If you think there isn't a lot for you to do to help ban landmines, you're wrong. Learn all you can about landmines. If there is no campaign in your country why not starting your own campaign? Talk with mine action and victim assistance authorities in your country, and tell them you wish to get involved and help step up efforts to complete landmine clearance. Go out and promote the importance of the treaty and the ban by calling radio stations, writing to news papers, taking to social media - just keep the conversation about landmines going. And lastly make a donation. Anyone of these actions can help so much.
