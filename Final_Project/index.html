<h3>The Landmine is the Perfect Soldier</h3>
		

<div class="content">

		A treaty was signed in 1997 that banned the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of mines and requires states to destroy their stockpiles and clear all mined areas as well as assist landmine survivors. 162 states have joined the Mine Ban Treaty. While the treaty was signed nearly 20 years ago mines however landmines are still a major issue today. 
	</p>	 

	<p>
		There is an estimated of 50 to 100 million land mines still in the ground today. Detection and removal of antipersonnel landmines is, a serious problem of political, economical, environmental and humanitarian dimension. 
	</p>

	<h5>It costs between $3-$30 to build a mine, but the cost of removing a mine is anywhere from $300 - $1,000.</h5>
	
	<p>
		The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of mines are major factors in explaining the widespread use of mines throughout the numerous countries that are now faced with dealing with the mine contamination problem.

	<h6> According to the 'International Campaign to Ban Landmines network', more than 4,200 people, of whom 42% are children, have been falling victim to landmines </h6>

<h4> Everything you need to know about landmines.</h4>
	<p>
	So what is a landmine? The Dictionary defines it as "a mine usually placed just below the surface of the ground and designed to be exploded usually by the weight of vehicles or troops passing over it â€”often used figuratively." They are designed to incapacitate that person or vehicle through damage caused by an explosive blast, fragments, (or, in the case of some antitank mines, a jet of molten metal). They are generally buried within 15 cm of the earth's surface, or laid above ground.
	</p>

	<p>
		Landmines can remain active more than 50 years after they are planted in the ground. For this reason, there is a growing worldwide effort to rid the world of landmines. Landmine detection is a slow, methodical process due to the danger involved in locating landmines. While location technology is improving, the following conventional techniques are still relied on heavily on using trained animals such as dogs or rats, using metal detectors or probing the ground. 
		It is estimated that there are 110 million active landmines.This means that there is one landmine for every 17 children in the world. Or, in other words, one landmine for every 52 people. Another 110 million landmines are stored ready to be used.
